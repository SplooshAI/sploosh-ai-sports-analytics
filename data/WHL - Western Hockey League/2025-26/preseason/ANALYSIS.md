## Strengths

1. **Offensive Flashes:** Despite the poor record, the team showed offensive capability in spurts, particularly in the win against Everett (7 goals) and competitive games against Portland and Penticton.

2. **Resilience:** The team demonstrated the ability to bounce back after the initial two blowout losses, showing improved competitiveness in the final four games.

3. **Third Period Play:** The Thunderbirds generally performed better in third periods, showing improved energy and execution as games progressed.

4. **Young Talent Development:** Several younger players received significant ice time, gaining valuable experience that will benefit the team during the regular season.

## Weaknesses

1. **Defensive Coverage:** The team allowed 34 goals in 6 games (5.67 GAA), indicating significant defensive issues, particularly in transition and defensive zone coverage.

2. **Slow Starts:** The team was outscored heavily in first periods, often putting them in early deficits that were difficult to overcome.

3. **Special Teams:** Both power play and penalty kill units struggled throughout the preseason, with the penalty kill being particularly vulnerable.

4. **Consistency:** Wide performance swings from game to game suggest the team is still finding its identity and developing chemistry.

## Areas of Concern

1. **Goaltending Stability:** The high goals-against average raises questions about goaltending depth and reliability.

2. **Defensive Structure:** Allowing 8 and 9 goals in games indicates fundamental defensive structure issues that need immediate attention.

3. **Team Discipline:** High penalty minutes in several games put additional pressure on an already struggling penalty kill.

4. **Home Ice Performance:** Going winless at home during preseason is concerning for regular season prospects.

## Overall Grade: D+

The Thunderbirds' 1-5-0-0 record and -17 goal differential reflect a challenging preseason. While there were occasional bright spots and improved competitiveness in the latter half of the exhibition schedule, the overall performance raises significant concerns heading into the regular season.

The lone win against Everett demonstrates the team's potential when executing properly, but consistency remains elusive. The defensive struggles are particularly troubling and will need to be addressed immediately if the team hopes to be competitive in the regular season.

## 2025-26 Regular Season Preview

### What to Expect

The Seattle Thunderbirds enter the 2025-26 WHL regular season following a difficult preseason that exposed several areas needing improvement. However, the regular season offers a fresh start with the full roster in place and systems fully implemented.

### Keys to Success

1. **Defensive Improvement:** Head Coach Matt O'Dette will need to focus on tightening defensive zone coverage and improving transition defense to reduce the high number of goals allowed during preseason.

2. **Special Teams Development:** Both power play and penalty kill units require significant work to become assets rather than liabilities.

3. **Stronger Starts:** Establishing better first-period play will be crucial to avoid playing from behind consistently.

4. **Home Ice Advantage:** After going winless at home during preseason, establishing the accesso ShoWare Center as a difficult place for opponents to play will be essential.

### Players to Watch

1. **Veteran Leadership:** The team will rely heavily on returning players to provide stability and leadership through the inevitable ups and downs of the season.

2. **Goaltending Competition:** The preseason struggles in net suggest that the goaltending position could see rotation until a clear starter emerges.

3. **Breakout Candidates:** Several younger players showed flashes of potential during preseason and could step into larger roles as the season progresses.

### Schedule Outlook

The Thunderbirds open their regular season with several divisional matchups that will immediately test whether the preseason struggles have been addressed. Early games against Everett, Portland, and Spokane will be particularly telling, as these teams exposed Seattle's weaknesses during preseason play.

### Prediction

Based on preseason performance, the Thunderbirds appear to be in a rebuilding phase. Fans should expect some growing pains early in the season as the coaching staff works to address the defensive issues and establish consistent special teams play.

A realistic goal would be to see steady improvement throughout the first half of the season, with the team becoming more competitive by the midway point. While a playoff spot is not out of the question, the team will likely be battling for one of the final positions in the Western Conference.

**Projected Regular Season Record:** 28-36-5-3 (64 points)
