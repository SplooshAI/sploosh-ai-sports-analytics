## Looking Ahead to Regular Season

### Strengths to Build On

- **Elite goaltending** that can steal games
- **Efficient scoring** when chances are created
- **Home ice advantage** at Climate Pledge Arena
- **Depth scoring** with contributions from multiple lines

### Focus Areas for Opening Week

1. **Improve possession metrics** - Generate more shots and offensive zone time
2. **Win more faceoffs** - Critical for controlling play and momentum
3. **Stay disciplined** - Reduce minor penalties to avoid power play situations
4. **Road consistency** - Find ways to win away from home
5. **Second period focus** - Come out of intermissions with better concentration

### Season Outlook

The Kraken finished the preseason with a 3-2-1 record, showing flashes of brilliance mixed with areas needing improvement. The goaltending and finishing ability are elite-level strengths that can carry the team through tough stretches. However, the possession and faceoff concerns must be addressed to compete consistently in the Pacific Division.

The team's ability to win games despite being outshot suggests a "bend but don't break" defensive philosophy combined with opportunistic offense. This style can be effective but requires near-perfect goaltending and high shooting percentages to sustain over an 82-game season.

**Key Question:** Can the Kraken maintain their elite shooting percentage and goaltending while improving their possession game?

The regular season will reveal whether the preseason trends are sustainable or if adjustments are needed. The strong home record (2-0-1) suggests Climate Pledge Arena will be a fortress, but the road struggles (1-2-0) indicate challenges ahead in away games.
