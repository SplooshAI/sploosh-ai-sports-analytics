# Welcome

Sports data is so much fun to explore! The below video fuels me with excitement and energy - captured from my seat to watch the Seattle Kraken in Round 2 of the Stanley Cup playoffs in only their second season üèí

## Getting started

This project explores working with a variety of APIs for sports data analysis and visualization.

### Let's look at some sample data

Before considering tooling and software to review and analyze data, we need to find some meaningful data we want to work with.

Please review the overview of sample data locally available within this project at [data/README.md](data/README.md).
